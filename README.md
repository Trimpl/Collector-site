# Collector-site
 It’s my first web-application, that I've made as a course work, when I was practicing at Itransision. 
Here you can add your own collections, edit and delete them. In collections you can add items with a number of description fields and you can add tags and choose existing tags. You can add commentary to the items and ‘like’ them. You can watch your collections and items in your Profile using tables. You can sort items in collection. On the main page you see tag cloud, last added items and collections with the largest number of items.
In this project I solved next problems:
- Authentication with Identity
- Localization (ru/ eng)
-Dark and white themes
-Likes and comment using AJAX
-Adaptive design using Bootstrap
